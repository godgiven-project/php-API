you can write every word or sentence in `.po` file
then comvert it to `.mo` with online or offline application.
when ever you put `.mo` file in language folder it will translate automatically.

REMEMBER !!!
if you want to write something new in php you can use `__('you_string')` function
to tell php first translate the string then use it.
